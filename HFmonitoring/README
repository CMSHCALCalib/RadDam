Step1: nTuplizer
- Get CMSSW_9_2_X and copy both directories in nTuplizer directory in CMSSW/src
- Do a 'scram b clean' followed by 'scram b -j10'
- Code is ready to use: macros are in nTuplizer/ggAnalysis/ggNtuplizer/test

Step2: Untuplizer
- Add nTuple paths in run macros and execute these with ROOT

Step3: Plotting
- Add analysisTree to Analysis17.h, open ROOT, create the Analysis17 class and execute the loop-function
- Add the ROOT file with the histograms in the MakePlots macro and execute this with ROOT
