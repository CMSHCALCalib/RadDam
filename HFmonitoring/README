Step1: nTuplizer
- Get CMSSW_9_2_X and copy both directories in nTuplizer directory in CMSSW/src
- Do a 'scram b clean' followed by 'scram b -j10'
- Code is ready to use: macros are in nTuplizer/ggAnalysis/ggNtuplizer/test

Step2: Untuplizer
- Add nTuple paths in run macros and run these with ROOT

Step3: Plotting
