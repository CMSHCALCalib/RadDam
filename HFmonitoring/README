Step0: clone code via 'git clone git@github.com:CMSHCALCalib/RadDam'

Step1: nTuplizer
- Setup CMSSW_10_2_9 and copy ggAnalysis directory in CMSSW/src
- Do a 'scram b clean' followed by 'scram b -j10'
- Code is ready to use (macros are in nTuplizer/ggAnalysis/ggNtuplizer/test): 
  # Submit CRAB jobs via crabConfig (NOTE: you can submit multiple samples at once using multiprocessing)
  # Samples of interest: (Data) SingleElectron/EGamma dataset, (MC) DYJetsToLL_M-50 MadGraph-MLM sample
  # Check the latest GlobalTag in the cmsRun macros (different for data & MC - see https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/PdmVAnalysisSummaryTable)

Step2: Untuplizer
- Use hadd to combine the nTuple trees (recommended to have one final MC file and one final data file for each run range)
- Compare the EGamma cut-based ID for ECAL electrons in xAna macros (~L220) with latest recommendations (https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/CutBasedElectronIdentificationRun2)
  # NOTE: usually we have to use the ID from the year before or very preliminary IDs
- Add hadded nTuple paths in run macros and execute these with ROOT

Step3: Plotting
- Add Data/MC analysisTree path to L90/92 in Analysis18.h and set isData bool in L45 in Analysis18.C accordingly
- Open ROOT, compile the Analysis18 class ('.L Analysis18.C+'), create a Analysis18 object ('Analysis18 t') and execute the loop-function ('t.Loop()')
- Create a 'Figures18' directory with the following subdirectories: Eta, Phi, PU, EtaPhiFit, EtaBin (and Run)
- Add the ROOT file with the histograms in the MakePlots macro and execute this with ROOT
